# LCA
Latent Class Analysis

Latent Class Analysis (LCA) is a statistical method used to identify unobserved (latent) subgroups within a population based on observed categorical variables. Think of it as discovering hidden patterns that explain why we see certain combinations of observable characteristics occurring together. At its core, LCA is a mixture model that assumes the overall population consists of a finite number of distinct, mutually exclusive and exhaustive subgroups (latent classes). 

In this study, we used LCA to identify co-occurrence patterns of S modifiers among participants in the Korean national lung cancer screening program.
